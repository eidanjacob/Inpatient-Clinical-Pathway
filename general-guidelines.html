General guidelines: 
Goal directed fluid management is the guiding principle for perioperative management. This paradigm consists of: 
•	Attempt to restrict crystalloid infusions to < 5ml/kg/hr.
•	Giving fluid volume as dictated by increasing base deficits, pulse pressure variation, or lactates.
•	Colloid or blood (check Hgb) for volume replacement when indicated by objective measures.
•	Periodic assessment (every 1-2 hours) of global perfusion: ABG, Hgb. 
•	Deliberate hypotension if appropriate. Aim for a mean blood pressure no less than 20 percent below baseline, and no less than 60 – 65 mmHg during periods of potential spinal cord compromise/ manipulation.
Blood Utilization: 
•	Intraoperative maintenance of hemoglobin level of at least 7-8 g/dl throughout surgical procedure, with adjustments as the clinical situation dictates. 
•	Utilization of Amicar/TXA to minimize blood loss.
•	Use of autologous blood products, if available, to address oxygen delivery concerns and avoid excessive crystalloid infusions to support intravascular volume. 
•	Cell Saver
•	Acute Isovolemic Hemodilution <!-- link -->
Anesthetic management must adequately perfuse a spinal cord at risk for ischemic insults, while permitting effective nervous system monitoring and minimizing blood loss. The surgeon and anesthesiologist should address specific risks for spinal cord ischemia in a patient with more advanced disease. In such cases, maintaining adequate cord perfusion takes precedence. 
Addressing possible blood loss during these procedures must be balanced with minimizing exposure to allogeneic blood products. Maintaining hemoglobin levels above 7-8 mg/dl for most patients is sufficient. More aggressive transfusions may be indicated for patients with increased risk for ischemic damage. 
Inadequate global perfusion may be evidenced by:
•	arterial blood pressure respiratory variation, 
•	increasing base deficit with anion gap
•	increasing lactate levels, or 
•	changes in neural monitoring signals.
These should be addressed expeditiously to increase global oxygen delivery. 
Deliberate hypotension can reduce intraoperative blood loss, but concerns regarding spinal cord perfusion and reports of postoperative visual loss have discouraged the practice. While length of surgery and large intraoperative blood loss are major risk factors most associated with visual complications to date, aggressive hypotensive techniques are coming under increasing scrutiny. The use of anti-fibrinolytic agents can significantly diminish blood loss during surgery at acceptable risk. These agents should especially be considered for children with a neuromuscular etiology for their scoliosis, or when procedures are expected to be difficult and prolonged.
